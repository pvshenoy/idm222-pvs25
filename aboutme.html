    <h2>Hi! I'm Preeti</h2>
    <p>
      I am a sophomore at Drexel University majoring in User Experience & Interaction Design. After realizing that I wanted to do something in the arts and psychology field, I stumbled upon UI/UX design, and went down the rabbit hole from there.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started my design career in 2018, and have taken multiple steps forward to accomplish my goal of becoming a UX designer. 
      When I am not designing something new, I like to paint, listen to music, play video games, and bike. I believe that your profession should be something that you enjoy, and I do believe that my hobbies helped influence my career choice. The passion I have for design comes from these hobbies. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My love for art helped me appreciate the design side of UX, and my appreciation for psychology led me to understand human-computer interactions better. 
      My plan as a student is to learn as much as I can about the field of UX and broaden my perspective on many other fields of study as well. At Drexel, I have access to the co-op program which alllows me to learn more about this field with hands-on experience. I plan to utilize this experience to improve as a designer and learn more about this growing industry.
